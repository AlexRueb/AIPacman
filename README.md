Pacman search algorithms

# Actual Progress:
Depth first search: should be completely done

Breadth first search: Pretty sure it actually worked just copy and pasting the depth first search algorithm over, changing the stack to a queue and the methods from push and pop to add and poll.

Greedy best-first search: skeleton

A* search: skeleton
