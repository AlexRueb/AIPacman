Pacman search algorithms

# Actual Progress:
Depth first search: should be completely done

Breadth first search: has code on it, does not work properly.
currently finds the path, but prints out every step it took, instead of only the steps in the answer.
TODO: create an array of nodes, use that instead of the array of chars.
*look at depth first for implementation*
pretty much copy depth first, but instead of using a stack, use a queue.
